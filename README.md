# Simple Integrated System

This research project showcases the development of an integrated system involving an embedded linux computer (Raspberry Pi) and a 32-bit microcontroller (STM32H723ZGT) with ARM processor utilizing I2C communication protocol. A Linux driver was developed which acts as an interface for the microcontroller to which peripheral devices are connected. Additionally, a custom protocol on top of I2C was designed and implemented to transfer complex data as structs.
